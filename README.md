# ObjectOrientedProgramming-ProjectBonus

Implement Matrix Multiplication for two randomly generated 1000 x 1000 integer matrices in four
different methods:
1) Implement using a single thread of execution.
2) Implement using 10 threads of execution.
3) Implement using 100 threads of execution.
4) Implement using 1000 threads of execution.
For each implementation, your program will keep track of the time. As output, state when each
implementation is starting and ending as well as the total time taken for that implementation.
